    "## Overview of Kafka\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get an overview of Kafka. It is nothing but an event streaming platform. It has 3 key capabilities as per the [official documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/intro).\n",
    "* To publish (write) and subscribe to (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.\n",
    "* To store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.\n",
    "* To process streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this functionality is provided in a distributed, highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and secure manner. Kafka can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers, and on-premises as well as in the cloud. You can choose between self-managing your Kafka environments and using fully managed services offered by a variety of vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the major vendors who provide managed services.\n",
    "* Amazon Web Services\n",
    "* Microsoft Azure\n",
    "* Confluent\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of our labs, we have a multinode Kafka cluster. You can take care of all possible use cases around Kafka on our powerful cluster where it is integrated with HDFS as well as Spark."
