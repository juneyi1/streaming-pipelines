    "Let us review the list of input sources that are supported out-of-the-box by Spark Structured Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **File source** - Reads files written in a directory as a stream of data. Files will be processed in the order of file modification time. If latestFirst is set, order will be reversed. Supported file formats are text, CSV, JSON, ORC, Parquet. See the docs of the DataStreamReader interface for a more up-to-date list, and supported options for each file format. Note that the files must be atomically placed in the given directory, which in most file systems, can be achieved by file move operations.\n",
    "* **Kafka source** - Reads data from Kafka. Itâ€™s compatible with Kafka broker versions 0.10.0 or higher. See the Kafka Integration Guide for more details.\n",
    "* **Socket source (for testing)** - Reads UTF8 text data from a socket connection. The listening server socket is at the driver. Note that this should be used only for testing as this does not provide end-to-end fault-tolerance guarantees.\n",
    "* **Rate source (for testing)** - Generates data at the specified number of rows per second, each output row contains a timestamp and value. Where timestamp is a Timestamp type containing the time of message dispatch, and value is of Long type containing the message count, starting from 0 as the first row. This source is intended for testing and benchmarking."
